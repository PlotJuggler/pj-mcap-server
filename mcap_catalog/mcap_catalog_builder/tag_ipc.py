"""The tag-edit IPC endpoint (catalog-migration §1.1 DECISION D2, option (a)).

The Go server is a read-only catalog reader; only this Python builder may write
the catalog. A client's ``UpdateTags`` wire RPC must therefore reach this
process somehow — D2(a) is: **Go forwards it over a local IPC endpoint; this
module applies it through the SAME single-writer queue everything else in
``__main__.py`` goes through.** The IPC server thread never touches the DB
itself — it only builds a :class:`TagEditItem` and enqueues it, then blocks on
its ``threading.Event`` for the worker thread's reply.

Wire shape: ``POST /update_tags`` over a UNIX domain socket, JSON body
``{"key": "<object key>", "set_tags": {...}, "unset_keys": [...]}``, JSON
response. See ``CATALOG_CONTRACT.md``'s "Tag-edit IPC" section for the full
contract (addressing rationale, deadline semantics, socket permissions).

**Bounded surface (B1).** This is a local IPC endpoint, not a public one, but
it is still reachable by anything with local access — so it is deliberately
bounded against a local DoS: request bodies are capped at ``MAX_BODY_BYTES``
(rejected with 413/400 *before* being read), each handler socket carries a
``HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`` read/write timeout, and at most ``MAX_PENDING_EDITS``
tag edits may be enqueued-but-unreplied at once (a non-blocking semaphore
acquired *before* enqueueing; failure to acquire is an immediate 503 that never
touches the work queue). See :class:`TagEditServer`'s docstring for the full
rationale.

    ``POST /update_tags`` (see :class:`_TagEditHTTPHandler`).

    **Bounded surface (B1, local-DoS hardening).** ``ThreadingMixIn`` spawns one
    thread per connection with no built-in cap, so three things bound the
    resulting resource usage: request bodies are capped at ``MAX_BODY_BYTES``
    (validated against ``Content-Length`` and rejected with 413/400 *before*
    any read); every handler socket carries a ``HANDLER_TIMEOUT_SECONDS``
    read/write timeout; and at most ``max_pending`` tag edits (default
    ``MAX_PENDING_EDITS``) may be enqueued-but-unreplied at once, enforced by a
    ``threading.BoundedSemaphore`` acquired NON-blocking in the handler
    *before* the item ever reaches ``work_q`` — acquisition failure is an
    immediate 503 that never enqueues, never spawns a ``TagEditItem``, and
    never leaves a handler thread parked on ``event.wait()``. Together these
    bound the number of pending ``TagEditItem``s (and de-facto the number of
    *useful* handler threads) regardless of how many connections a local
    client opens.

    **Socket lifecycle (S3).** A stale socket file left at ``socket_path`` by a
    prior daemon is unlinked before bind — but only after confirming via
    ``stat.S_ISSOCK`` that it really IS a UNIX socket special file; a regular
    file or directory already occupying that path is a conflict, not "staleness",
    and fails startup with a clear error rather than being silently clobbered.
    After bind, the socket is ``chmod``'d ``0o660`` (owner+group read/write only
    — the socket is a local-machine-only trust boundary, never the auth
    boundary; see the contract doc) and its freshly-bound inode is captured.
    ``server_close()`` re-``stat``s ``socket_path`` and unlinks it only if the
    inode still matches what we bound — if it changed (another daemon replaced
    the socket while we were still up, e.g. during a slow shutdown racing a new
    instance's startup), the unlink is skipped and logged instead of deleting
    that other daemon's live socket.
