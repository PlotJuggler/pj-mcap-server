"""Tests for the single-writer process lock (CATALOG_CONTRACT.md §11).

The catalog's whole design assumes ONE builder process per served DB path (the
"sole writer"). Before the lock, that was a deploy convention only: a second
daemon would treat the first one's live tag socket as stale, remove it, and two
reconcilers would race writes to the same DB. The lock makes the convention a
kernel-enforced invariant: flock(LOCK_EX|LOCK_NB) on `<db>.writer.lock`, held
for the process lifetime, auto-released by the kernel on ANY process death (no
stale-pidfile hazard).
