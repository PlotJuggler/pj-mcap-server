"""The catalog builder core: dimension resolution + the §8 per-file transaction.

The core (``catalog_object`` / ``delete_by_key``) is **backend-agnostic**: it
talks to a storage ``Source`` (local FS or S3), never to ``os``/``open`` directly.
``catalog_file`` / ``delete_by_path`` are thin local-filesystem wrappers kept for
the watcher path and the existing tests.

Correctness guards (this daemon is the catalog's only writer):
- dimensions are trusted only if ``rebuild_hive_key(dims) == key`` (round-trip);
- the ``topic_counts`` blob is built from the sorted topic-set members with a
  ``.get(channel_id, 0)`` default, then an in-transaction check
  ``sum(counts) == message_count`` rolls a bad row into ``catalog_failures``;
- on rollback the in-memory caches are reloaded from the committed DB state, so
  ids inserted inside the rolled-back transaction can never poison the caches.
