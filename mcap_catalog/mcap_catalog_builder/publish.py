"""Atomic catalog publish: build to a temp DB, then swap it in (catalog-migration
§6.2a).

In-place WAL mutation (``db.open_db`` + a normal reconcile) stays the norm for an
existing, schema-compatible catalog — it is transactionally safe per file (the
composite-key upsert preserves ``files.id``, the wire ``file_id`` contract) even
though a reader can observe a mid-reconcile state. This module exists for the two
cases where that in-place norm is unsafe: **creating** a catalog that does not yet
exist, and **rebuilding** one from scratch. Mutating (or first creating) the SERVED
path directly would expose a reader to a torn, half-built catalog; replacing a WAL
database file while its old ``-wal`` sidecar survives is a documented SQLite
corruption vector (stale frames replayed into the new file's generation).

Protocol (``build_and_publish``):

1. Build the whole catalog in a temp file (``<served_path>.building``), never
   touching the served path.
1a. Carry ``tags_override`` rows forward from the OLD served DB (if any) into
   the temp DB, by composite file identity — user tag edits are NOT derivable
   from the bucket, so a rebuild would otherwise silently lose them
   (``_carry_forward_tags_override``; best-effort on an unreadable old DB; an
   override whose file no longer exists in the new build is dropped).
2. Checkpoint the temp file down to zero WAL frames and close it, so it is a
   single self-contained file with no ``-wal``/``-shm`` sidecars. This is
   *verified*, not assumed: the checkpoint's own ``busy``/``log_frames``/
   ``checkpointed_frames`` result is checked (the same condition as step 3's
   gate); if it ever comes back partial (e.g. a future ``build_fn`` leaks a
   second connection to the temp path), the publish ABORTS rather than risk
   deleting a non-empty ``-wal`` and shipping a catalog missing committed frames.
3. If a served DB already exists (the rebuild case), checkpoint-gate it: force its
   ``-wal`` to zero frames before the swap, so no reader can later replay stale
   frames from the pre-swap generation into the post-swap file. If a concurrent
   reader holds it busy past a bounded window, ABORT — never rename over an
   un-checkpointed served DB. Otherwise (fresh create — no served DB yet), clear
   any orphaned ``<served_path>-wal``/``-shm`` sidecars now, BEFORE the rename
   (an operator may have deleted the main DB by hand but left them behind) — a
   reader must never be able to open the new main file next to a stale non-empty
   WAL from an unrelated prior generation.
4. ``os.replace`` the temp file onto the served path (atomic, same filesystem).
5. Unlink any stale ``-wal``/``-shm`` left over at the served path's old generation
   (belt-and-braces for the rebuild case — step 3 should already leave it at zero
   frames; a no-op in the create case, already handled by step 3).
6. ``fsync`` the containing directory.

Durability note: publish durability is rename-atomic + directory-fsync only — the
catalog is a rebuildable cache of the bucket (see ``CATALOG_CONTRACT.md``), so a
lost write beyond that boundary (e.g. true power loss) is acceptable; the next
build reconstructs it from the bucket.

The reader's swap trigger is (dev, inode) identity polling on the served path, NOT
``build_metadata.build_id`` — the ``build_id`` counter is a freshness/confirmation
value only (see the "Publish & reopen protocol" section of ``CATALOG_CONTRACT.md``).
